# 🚀 Nowa Free Plan Just Got a Big Upgrade — Unlimited Code, Local Projects, and AI!

**Hey builders!**

Big news — with the launch of **Nowa 3.0**, we’ve made some major changes to our pricing plans to make Nowa way more accessible for everyone!  
We preserved our pricing and added more to every plan — and made the **Free Plan** way more useful!

---

## 💡 Why we did this

From day one, our goal has been simple:  
**Help you build awesome, successful apps without the pain of dealing with code.**

We believe your energy should go into solving real problems for your end users — not wasting time on technical headaches that don’t add value.

So we’ve been working on a way to make the building experience not just visual, but also more **creative and fun** — and now, we're making that power available to **everyone**, including those on the Free Plan!

---

## 🚀 What’s new in the Free Plan?

We don’t want you to just “try” Nowa — we want you to actually **build real apps** and get full value, even on the Free Plan!

Here’s what’s now included in the **Starter (Free) Plan**:

- ✅ Unlimited projects  
- ✅ Unlimited code downloads  
- ✅ Full access to the desktop version  
- ✅ Unlimited local projects  
- ✅ Hot reload support  
- ✅ Hybrid visual + code building  
- ✅ 5 AI messages per month

## 🛠️ What that means for you

Even if you're just getting started or testing things out, you can now:

- Build anything with our visual tools  
- Add as many API endpoints as you want (yes, **unlimited!**)  
  *(Funny enough, other tools limit API endpoints even for paying users.)*  
- Download the full Flutter source code and run it anywhere — Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux — all from one codebase  
- Work locally on your own machine and run your app in simulators or real devices  

### Bonus: Hot reload + hybrid mode

- Use **hot reload** with a simulator or your phone — changes show up in under 2 seconds  
- Work side-by-side with your favorite IDE (like VS Code) and see changes instantly  
- Set up **Git** just like any project — commit, branch, push, whatever you want  

---

## 🤖 Free AI too? Yup.

Nowa 3.0 introduces a **super powerful AI agent** that can:

- Build full screens or components from a single prompt  
- Hook up APIs or Supabase  
- Fix bugs  
- Turn screenshots into working UIs  
- Answer questions about your project  

Even on the Free Plan, you get **5 AI messages per month** to try it out.  
Need more? You can upgrade to the **Launch** or **Scale** plans.

---

## 🌐 Free Web Publishing

Want to share your app? You can now **publish it to the web** as a free user.

The link stays live for **12 hours**, perfect for testing or showing it to friends, users, or stakeholders.

---

## 💸 About the paid plans

We renamed the old **Pro** and **Premium** plans — they’re now called **Launch** and **Scale**.

### 🚀 Launch

Great for indie builders who want more AI + web hosting:

- 50 AI messages/month  
- Unlimited web builds (host anywhere)  
- Live web publishing with custom domain  
- Extra support from the team  

### ⚡ Scale

Built for teams or pros working on big projects:

- 200 AI messages/month (with top-ups available)  
- GitHub integration  
- 1-click deploy to iOS + Android (and future updates)  
- Premium support (we’ll even hop on a 1:1 call if needed)  

### 🏢 Custom plans

Need something tailored to your company or team? We’ve got you covered.

## ❤️ Why we’re doing this

We’ve seen other platforms (👀 FlutterFlow) push new pricing changes that make plans more restrictive — even hurting loyal users.

We decided to go the other way:  
**Keep pricing simple, add more to every plan, and give even more to free users.**

Because we genuinely want you to succeed. That’s the whole point.

Let’s build something amazing together. 💥
