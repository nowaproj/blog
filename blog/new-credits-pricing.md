# Introducing Credits — A Fairer, Clearer Pricing Model

We’re excited to share an update to how usage works in Nowa.  
Instead of a flat “per message” charge, we’re moving to credits based on the actual tokens your prompts use. Smaller prompts use fewer credits; larger prompts use more. It’s fair, simple, and easier to understand.

## Why we changed it

Per‑message billing often led to long, packed prompts just to “count once.” That made prompts produce worse quality results since it's always a good practice when dealing with LLMs to keep prompts small and focused for more accurate and better results.

Credits align cost with usage. When you use fewer tokens, you spend fewer credits. When your prompt is more complex, you spend a bit more. You pay for what you use — nothing more.

## How credits work

- Credits are now token‑based, not message‑based  
- Short prompts typically use a fraction of a credit
- Longer prompts and outputs use more credits, proportionally  
- You can see usage per prompt and for the whole chat

Examples

- “Make this Card widget look more modern/elegant.” Typically ~0.05–0.10 credits. Previously, this would have been a full message regardless of tokens.  
- “Create a modern todo home page with add/delete/complete logic.” About 1 credit on average.

## Transparent usage

We made it very clear to see the input token, output token and credit consumption for each message you sent, as well as for the entire chat.

Going to the settings, you will see exactly your consumption in the last days with exact time, credits, tokens, etc

## What this means for your plan

This means you will be able to use AI agent more often than before with the exact same plan.

We changed the "messages" to "credits" while keeping the same number, so for Launch plan you have **50 credits** instead of 50 messages, and same goes for Scale plan having **200 credits** instead of 200 messages.

This is beside the AI agent becoming 4x faster and produces 3x better results than the previous versions.

## Limits reset with Nowa 3.1

To support the transition, we reset usage limits with the Nowa 3.1 release.  
There’s no need to wait for your monthly cycle — your credits are refreshed, even if you used some earlier in your subscription.
